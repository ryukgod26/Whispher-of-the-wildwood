# WHISPHER OF THE WOODS
This is my new Game. This is a Startegic Game Where You Atack on Other Bases (I will try to make this game online). You can Collect Gold and Elixir from Attacking or from the resouces in your Base(Resources will be added later.)

## CURRENT PHASE
Currently I am working on troops and defenses. There are three troops Currently Availaible : Wood Cutter, Grave Robber , Steam Man
The Only Defense I have Created now is a canon which shoots cannon balls when a troop is in its range.
I have Created a Training Scene Where Player can Train their troops. Currently there is no limit in number of troops a player can train  and also there is no resources required to train a troop. But i will add them in future Updates.
There is a Gold and Elixir Bar which are Currently Empty but They will be updated when I addd resources in futyure Updates.
### TROOP SPECIALITIES
1. Wood Cutter: It is a basic troop Troop with DAMAGE of 2 and Health of 3.
2. Grave Robber: It is a more like more damage Troop with Damage of 3 and health of 2.(It might become a range troop in future updates)
3. Steam Man: It is more of a tank Troop with health of 5 and damage of 5 but has a debuff of speed.
